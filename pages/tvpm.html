      Located in the southwestern tip of India, Thiruvananthapuram is bound by the Arabian Sea 
      in the west and Tamil Nadu in the east. Named after Anantha Padmanabha or Lord Vishnu, 
      the city is home to many ancient temples. But the landmark is the Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple 
      around which the city has been built on seven low hills. The wooded highlands of the Western Ghats 
      in the eastern and northeastern borders give Thiruvananthapuram some of the most enchanting 
      picnic spots. A long shoreline with internationally renowned beaches, historic monuments, 
      backwater stretches and a rich cultural heritage make this district a much sought-after 
      tourist destination. Clean and green, Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala is one of the 
      most beautiful cities in the country.

        <h5>Kovalam</h5>
        <img src="../assets/images/kovalam-cover.jpg" alt="Kovalam-Beach" width="80%">
        <p>Kovalam is an internationally renowned beach with three adjacent crescent beaches. It has been a favourite haunt of tourists since the 1930s. A massive rocky promontory on the beach has created a beautiful bay of calm waters ideal for sea bathing.<br>
          <br>
          The leisure options at this beach are plenty and diverse. Sunbathing, swimming, herbal body toning massages, special cultural programmes and catamaran cruising are some of them. The tropical sun acts so fast that one can see the faint blush of coppery tan on the skin in a matter of minutes. Life on the beach begins late in the day and carries on well into the night. The beach complex includes a string of budget cottages, Ayurvedic health resorts, convention facilities, shopping zones, swimming pools, Yoga and Ayurvedic massage centres.<br>
          <br>
          Accommodation facilities for tourists at Kovalam range from five star hotels to budget hotels and the choice of food available at restaurants and cafeterias range from Continental varieties to South Indian delicacies.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          Thiruvananthapuram, the capital city of Kerala, is just 16 km away from Kovalam and getting there is no hassle. But if you are on holiday it is better to stay in Kovalam and visit the city. The city of Thiruvananthapuram has many interesting places to see like the Napier Museum, the Sri Chitra Art Gallery and the Padmanabhaswamy Temple. The SMSM Institute, a State owned handicrafts emporium, is the ideal place to pick up ethnic curios and other articles.&nbsp;</p>

          Families and friends alike are known to go on long drives up the winding paths 
          for a view they insist rivals any other in the State. The slopes shrouded in mist fill 
          one with a feeling of wonder and amazement. A large amount of rare flora and 
          fauna can be seen here including mountain flowers, wild orchids and exotic butterflies.</p>

        <p>The temperature is equable throughout the year and the three hour drive 
          from the city is justified once the valley comes into view. One can always 
          stopover at the breath-taking Kallar River on the way, which flows parallel 
          to the road in the opposite direction, with the picturesque Meenmutty 
          Waterfalls only a little distance ahead. A large number of cottages and 
          resorts have come up in the area. The tree house view tower is another great 
          place to visit. Ponmudi is indeed a rising hotbed of tourist activity.

          hidden away from the casual eyes. All day you can walk through the promising
