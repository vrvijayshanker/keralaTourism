    One of the premier trade capitals of the Old World, Kollam is the centre 
    of the country’s cashew trading and processing industry. Extolled by 
    Marco Polo and Ibn Batuta in glowing terms, this was once a famous port 
    of international spice trade. This historic town is home to the celebrated 
    Ashtamudi Lake, making it a gateway to the breath-taking backwaters of 
    Kerala. The eight-hour boat trip between Kollam and Alappuzha is the 
    longest and most enchanting experience on the backwaters of Kerala. 
    The momentous decision to introduce a new Malayalam era was convened at 
    Kollam and hence the Malayalam calendar came to be known as kollavarsham.

        <h5>Jatayu Rock</h5>
        <img src="/assets/images/jatayu-cover.jpg" alt="Jatayu" width="80%">
        <p>The world’s largest bird sculpture and within it a rock theme park for adventure enthusiasts is what today pays tribute to the mythical bird from the Indian epic Ramayana – Jatayu.</p>

        <p>Legend has it that Jatayu tried to save Sita (wife of Lord Rama) when Ravana, a demon king, was abducting her in his airborne chariot. Jatayu is said to have fought valiantly and fallen on these rocks, grievously injured.</p>
        
        <p>The Jatayu Adventure Center (Jatayu Earth's Center), at Chadayamangalam, 50 km from Thiruvananthapuram, is a unique combination of artistry, mythology, technology, culture, adventure, leisure,&nbsp;and wellness. The virtual reality museum and the theatrical magic that renders the story of Jatayu add to the magic of the destination.</p>
        
        <p>A creation of Mr. Rajiv Anchal, this destination is sure to leave each visitor awestruck. The state of the art ropeway offers one a bird’s eye view of God’s Own Country just as the helicopter rides do as well.</p>
        
        <p>The Jatayu Adventure Center offers the largest adventure park within a natural terrain. Paintball, valley crossing, bouldering, zip line, trekking, archery, rappelling, jumaring and wall climbing are among the myriad activities available here.

        <h5>Punalur Suspension Bridge</h5>
        <img src="/assets/images/punalur-slide.jpg" alt="Punalur-bridge" width="80%">
        <p xss="removed">There is a gentle wobble, as you plant your feet on the wooden planks of this ancient hanging bridge. Take a few more steps and you will be staring at the Kallada river coursing merrily beneath. It is strangely quiet here at night, except for the occasional gurgle of the waters. There is a nip in the air, and silence thrums around you. It is the kind of place that makes you sigh, and lets your mind wander.&nbsp; There is another wobble, a soft reminder that more visitors are on their way to explore this 19th century marvel. The bridge is at its prettiest at night, as it stands washed in a golden yellow iridescent hue, illuminated by all the lamps around it. Only as the occasional babble of the city grows louder that you notice you are in the midst of a buzzing town.<br>
          <br>
          Right in the centre of the bustling life of Punalur town in Kollam stands the Punalur Suspension Bridge, flaunting an architectural style unlike any you can find in Kerala. With massive, towering stone arches, this unique 400-ft bridge which once allowed vehicular movement is now open only to foot traffic.&nbsp; The bridge was set up in 1877 and its design defies explanation. It remains suspended from iron chains, one end of all of them being connected to the insides of four huge wells.<br>
          <br>
          The bridge was constructed during the time of the erstwhile Travancore Maharaja Ayilyam Thirunal Rama Varma under the supervision of the British engineer Albert Henry. The construction began in 1871, and most of the materials were imported from England. The bridge is a mix of iron, wood and masonry. The wood used was Kambam wood. &nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          The bridge was built to prevent the entry of wild animals which were known to destroy crops and cause huge losses to the villagers. It also facilitated trade in Kollam and ushered in major developments in the place. &nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          The bridge is now a protected monument under the Archaeological Department of Kerala, and is open only to pedestrians. Renovation works were carried out on the bridge and it was opened to public in 2014. Seating arrangements are provided near the bridge and there is ample lighting around it at night.<br>
          <br>
          This suspension bridge which changed the face of Kollam surely has many a story to whisper. And it continues to make one marvel at its colossal structure.</p>

        <h5>Thangassery</h5>
        <img src="/assets/images/thangasseri_kover.jpg" alt="thangasseri" width="80%">
        <p>The British called this delightful destination ‘Dutch Quilon’ while the locals refer to it as 'gold village’. Today, the seaside town of Thangasseri is among the most historically significant locations in all of God’s Own Country. It is located 5 km away from Kollam town, and has a series of forts and churches that regularly attract a large amount of people. The Portuguese and the Dutch were responsible for a majority of them, and they give one a glimpse at the initial phase of their time as rulers of the place. Its legendary Lighthouse was built in 1902 and stands 144 ft. high, and can be seen over 13 miles away at sea. Observing the simultaneous rise of the sun and the moon while cruising on the popular Lighthouse Road offers you one of the finest visuals in the entire State.</p>
