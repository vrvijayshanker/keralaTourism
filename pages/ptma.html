      A hilly province of pristine splendour, the district of Pathanamthitta is hailed as the headquarters of pilgrim worship in Kerala. Three rivers course through its prosperous terrains comprising natural divisions of the lowlands, the midlands and the highlands. Interspersed with temples, rivers, mountain ranges and coconut groves, more than fifty per cent of the total area of this region is covered by forests.

Pathanamthitta has been dubbed a Heritage Village as it attracts visitors from all over the world for its spectacular water fiestas, religious shrines and cultural training centres. Pathanamthitta is also home to the unique AranmulaKannadi - metal mirrors that are meticulously handcrafted and the VasthuVidyaGurukulam, a village which practices the ancient Indian school of architecture.

        <h5>Gavi</h5>
        <img src="../assets/images/ptm-gavi-cover.jpg" alt="Gavi" width="80%">
        
        <p>Gavi Eco-Tourism , a project of the Kerala Forest Development Corporation, has caught the attention of tourists for a while now. The project is exclusive in many respects and the majority who visited were nature lovers and adventure tourists. Over a short period of time visitors to Gavi gradually increased, especially after 'Alistair International' the world acclaimed tourism major listed it among the leading eco-tourism centres and one of the must-see places in India.</p>

          <p>A highlight of the Gavi Eco Project is the involvement of the local populace in its activities as guides, gardeners and cooks. This provides livelihood for the locals and also helps to create awareness on the conservation of nature. Gavi, located in Pathanamthitta district offers its visitors activities like trekking, wildlife watching, outdoor camping in specially built tents and night safaris.</p>

          <p>The road leading to Gavi is blanketed by tea plantations, which itself is a refreshing experience. En route to Gavi are places of interest like Mundakayyam, Kuttikanam, Peermedu and Vandiperiyar from where the road deviates to Gavi.</p>

          <p>Once you reach Gavi the serene eco-lodge 'Green Mansion' awaits you like a mother to embrace you in its protective fold. From the 'Green Mansion', one can savour the spectacular view of the Gavi Lake and the adjoining forests. Besides the accommodation provided in 'Green Mansion' visitors can also try out the tree houses here and can even pitch tents in the wilderness. Here one can have outstanding trekking experiences, which are overseen by trained local people. Those who would love to be left alone can do so in the tranquil environs of Gavi or may even go canoeing in the placid waters of the lake or enjoy a breathtaking sunset. Visitors are usually provided vegetarian food and snacks, which further adds to the eco-friendly ambience of the place.</p>

          <p>The place is rich in flora and fauna. There are hills and valleys, tropical forests, sprawling grasslands, sholas, cascading waterfalls and cardamom plantations. Endangered species including the Nilgiri Tahr and Lion-Tailed Macaque are often sighted at the outskirts of Gavi. With more than 260 species of birds including the Great Pied Hornbill, Woodpecker and Kingfishers, Gavi is literally a paradise for birdwatchers.</p>

          <p>Some of the breathtaking viewpoints at Gavi like the Valley View offer a spectacular view of the deep ravine and forest below. From Kochu Pampa, a point near Green Mansion eco-lodge, one can track the grazing Nilgiri Tahrs.</p>

          <p>The famous pilgrim destination, Sabarimala is a short trek from Gavi. For those interested in observing nocturnal wildlife, night safaris to Kullur, Gavi Pullumedu, Kochu Pampa and Pachakanam provide ample opportunities for wildlife viewing.</p>

          <p>Another unique feature of Gavi is camping in the forests. One can pitch a tent in the camping site, which is a rarity in many Indian forests. As the dusk stretches into the silence of the night, one can feel the presence of wildlife in the middle of nowhere, an experience that cannot be explained in words. There are also tree top houses where one can enjoy avian life to the fullest.</p>

          <p>Active involvement of tribals in Gavi makes it a unique venture of its kind in the country. Traditional knowledge of the forest and its way of life helps Gavi to sustain its surroundings in its original state.</p>

          <p>Gavi is bound to cast its magical spell on every visitor and is surely a place that should not be missed in one's lifetime. Gavi is pristine, and it belongs to the wild, which is a reminder that visitors are responsible for their intentions and actions, which will have a bearing on the upkeep of Gavi for a long time to come.&nbsp;</p>

        <h5>Perumthenaruvi</h5>
        <img src="../assets/images/PtmPerumthenaruvi.jpg" alt="Perumthenaruvi-waterfall" width="80%">
        <p>Perhaps it could be because of the presence of a holy temple&nbsp; (Sabarimala)&nbsp;near, Perumthenaruvi too basks in its own myths.&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin with, you may wonder how the waterfall gets that strange name - Perumthenaruvi - which means in English, the river of honey. Only when you get to this place you see the reason hanging down from branches of trees and rocky ledges.&nbsp;Ten kilometers from Erumeli, where the annual pilgrimage to the temple begins, Perumthenaruvi is located in the dense Sabarimala forest.</p>
        <p>The first thing you notice as you get near the falls is the sheer number of beehives in the locality. What do bees find so attractive in Perumthenaruvi, you ask aloud! Is it because of the pristine nature of the woods, which are not yet desecrated by the presence of civilization? We hardly may come to any convincing answer, but at least we know how the name Perumthenaruvi has come to be.</p>
        <p>Perumthenaruvi is about 10 km from Erumeli.</p>
