        <h2>Kerala at a Glance</h2>
        
        <p>
            Flanked by the Arabian Sea in the West, the towering Western Ghats in the East and networked by 
            44 interconnected rivers, Kerala is blessed with a unique set of geographical features that 
            have made it one of the most sought after tourist destinations in Asia. A long shoreline 
            with serene beaches, tranquil stretches of emerald backwaters, lush hill stations and 
            exotic wildlife, are just a few of the wonders that await you once you crossover to the 
            other side. And what's more, each of these charming destinations is only a two hour drive 
            from the other - a singular advantage no other place on the planet can offer.</p>

        <p>Kerala prides itself for being the flag bearer for not just how a culture can respect its 
            past but also march forward with growth & progress as well. Hundred percent literacy, 
            world-class health care systems, India's lowest infant mortality and highest life expectancy 
            rates are among a few of the milestones that the people of the state are extremely proud of.

                <p>
                    Kerala is divided into three geographical regions: Highlands, which slope down from the Western 
                    Ghats onto the Midlands of undulating hills and valleys into an unbroken 580 km long coastline with 
                    many picturesque backwaters, interconnected with canals and rivers. The wild lands are covered with dense 
                    forests, while other regions lie under tea and coffee plantations or other forms of cultivation. 
                    Most of the state is engulfed in rich greenery which ensures a very calming experience at all times.

                <p>
                    Bestowed with a pleasant and equable climate throughout the year, Kerala is a tropical land where 
                    one can relax and be at ease. The Monsoons (June-September and October-November) and summer (February-May) 
                    are the seasons markedly experienced here, while Winter is only a slight drop in temperature 
                    from the normal range of 28-32Â°C. The generally pleasant climate prevalent here is what our guests end up loving.

                <h3>People and Life</h3>

                <p>
                    Kerala is one of India's most progressive states in terms of social welfare 
                    and quality of life. The State boasts of one of India's highest literacy rates, 
                    highest life expectancy and lowest child mortality rates. The literacy rate for 
                    women in Kerala is one of the highest in all of Asia. Enjoying a unique 
                    cosmopolitan viewpoint, the people here, at all levels of society, have greater 
                    access to services and opportunities - as well as a greater say in their governance.

                <p>
                    Kerala's history is closely linked with its commerce, which until recent 
                    times revolved around its spice trade. Celebrated as the Spice Coast of India, 
                    ancient Kerala played host to travellers and traders from across the world including 
                    the Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Chinese, Portuguese, Dutch, French and the British. Almost 
                    all of them have left their imprints on this land in some form or the other and that has 
                    helped us mould and design our own special way of interacting with the world.
